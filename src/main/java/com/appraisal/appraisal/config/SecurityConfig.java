/**
 * Central security policy: which routes are public, which need a role,
 * and where JwtAuthFilter sits in the request pipeline.
 *
 * ROLE MODEL (from Roles enum): HR, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE.
 *   - /api/auth/**     -> public (login has to be reachable before
 *                         anyone has a token)
 *   - GET /api/hr/cycles -> any authenticated user. Cycles are shared
 *                         reference data (managers building reports,
 *                         employees filtering appraisals, HR creating
 *                         them) — not HR-exclusive despite living under
 *                         /api/hr. Declared before the blanket HR rule
 *                         below since Spring Security matches top-down.
 *   - /api/hr/**        -> HR only (everything else under this prefix)
 *   - /api/manager/**  -> MANAGER only (covers both "managing my team"
 *                         endpoints like /team, /goals, AND "acting as
 *                         an employee" endpoints like /my-appraisals,
 *                         /my-goals — all live under this one prefix
 *                         in ManagerController, all require a MANAGER)
 *   - /api/employee/** -> EMPLOYEE only. Confirmed intentional: manager
 *                         and employee dashboards/UIs are entirely
 *                         separate in the frontend (different layouts,
 *                         different functionality, no shared components
 *                         calling across the boundary), so locking
 *                         managers out of /api/employee/** entirely is
 *                         both correct and the more secure (least-
 *                         privilege) choice.
 *
 * CSRF is disabled because this is a stateless REST API authenticated
 * by JWT in the Authorization header, not by session cookies — CSRF
 * protection exists specifically to defend cookie-based session auth,
 * so it doesn't apply here and would only get in the way of non-browser
 * clients (Postman, mobile apps, etc.).
 *
 * Session policy is STATELESS — Spring Security must never create or
 * rely on an HttpSession; every request re-authenticates itself purely
 * from its JWT, via JwtAuthFilter.
